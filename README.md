# MC Ckin Viewer

MC Skin Viewer is a Wordpress plugin whose purpose is to add a 3D animated render of a Minecraft skin in a wordpress article.

# How to use it

Use the plugin icon (the one that looks like a grey minecraft skin with a `+` symbol) to open a popup asking for the skin URL.

And that's it. The plugin will add a shortcode in your editor, and the page will render the skin in 3D !
